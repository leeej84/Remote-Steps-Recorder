# Remote-Steps-Recorder
Run the steps recorder remotely for any domain joined machines to help with troubleshooting issues with users desktops and applications.

The idea around the remote steps recorder is to enable administrators to capture a reproduction of a problem over the phone or via IM 
without having to teach users how to user any additional tools.

The administrator can remotely advise the users to reproduce the problem they are experiencing and the tool will enable to administrator to launch the steps recorder for the user remotely which will track the issue and then place the package of screenshots and information
on a fileshare to be picked up and reviewed.

The tool requires only requires remote PowerShell management be enabled.
